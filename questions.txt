Questions for EPIONCHO IBM client:

1)
treat.prob is defined as an integer (65), but is handled as a probability in the code (see function os.cov)
This is further evidenced by the 'other' epioncho github repo, which uses 0.75 where 65 has been used
It is also unclear how:
`covrg <- covrg / (1 - nc.age)` in os.cov ought be calculated, as a value over 1 is mathematically possible. This would be inappropriate for a probability, which is what it appears to be used as.

This has been implemented by our interpretation.

2)
The number of iterations in the main 'while' loop is in days. Coming to ~14,640 total iterations with the current values.
This might be ok, but many yearly calculations - such as yearly exposure to blackflies (see use of s.a.exp with yearly variable m.exp = 1.08 - the male yearly exposure rate) - use variables which are explicity for yearly resolution. To apply these every day appears to be explicitly incorrect usage.

3)
What is the source / meaning of the value '0.03' assigned to int.L1/2/3 on line 492?

4)
Why is the vector dh, created using m, beta, dh, expos, and L3 then again multiplied by each of these in Wplus1.rate?
delta.h Line 177
Wplus1.rate Line: 230

5)
pnc = 0.05 is ambiguous. There is no mention of the value or of the symbol anywhere in the document.
Appears to be used regarding individual compliance.
L 824 ep.equi.sium

pncomp appears to be unused in os.cov
L 16 in os.cov

6)
What is 'm' in the delta.h functions? defined as `ABR * ((1/104) / 0.63)`
We define it as annual transmission potential (ATP), but the R implementation does not align with the paper's definition of ATP
